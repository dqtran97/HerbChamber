Arduino_code will read data from sensors, controlling the water pump, light, and solenoids. 
Arduino_code will also sent the received data from sensors, transmit them to ESP8266.
ESP8266 will receive the data from arduino, then send it to the cloud. 

UNO.ino and wifi.ino establishing serial connection, sending data from esp to uno.
NOTE: We need to do the reverse.
